# Introduction
Customer segmentation is crucial for every business to better understand their customers, to keep customers satisfied, and to develop personalized products and services. In this project, we study using data mining techniques to segment customers . 

# Objective
The objectives of this project is to construct a customer segmentation model based on customer purchase behaviours and to help business better understand its customers and support their customer-centric marketing strategy. The proposed segmentation model is regarding to Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values generated from purchase behaviours, customers have been segmented into numerous groups based on their similarity, and the profile for each group is identified based on their characteristics. Accordingly, recommendations are provided to the business on marketing strategy and further analysis.

# Project Description

![projdesign](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67309506/121684570-885c8700-cac7-11eb-8bb5-920a44edc2e4.JPG)

The analysis of customer RFM initiates by grouping customers based on their buying behavior, in terms of How recently did they shop, how often did they shop, and how much monetary value they contributed to the store.
In RFM Analysis, three parameters are analyzed, each denoted by the letters R, F, and M. To satisfy the need of knowing true customer value, analysis of just one parameter will give an inaccurate report of the customer base, so the customer’s lifetime value can’t be reliable. This is why at least three parameters of customer’s purchase behavior are analyzed; with the freedom to add other analytical parameters too
It provides a simple intuitive way of calculating each of the three aspects in a simple rating of 1-5, where 1 is the least important and 5 is the most important one. For example, a customer with R=5, F=5, and M=5 is the most profitable and loyal customer, while a customer with R=1, F=1, and M=1 is the least contributing one

# Conclusions 
It is a fact that every company benefits from customer segmentation. With RFM-analysis, different groups of customers with similar characteristics can be quickly identified and business-relevant insights can be deduced. It offers many advantages such as its universal application in various areas (finance, marketing, sales) as well as its adaptability and flexibility. 
From the analysis we can learn that
•	Categorizing of the customers can be done based on the RFM score
•	After categorizing various offers can be offered to the customers to maximize the sales
•	To make the things more customer friendly product recommendation is done.

# Further Work
In this project customer segmentation, product recommendation and its analysis was done based on RFM and products present in the dataset. There are many other parameters such as age group, gender, region etc.
In future we can
•	Perform analysis on the basis of age, gender etc.
•	A backend model can be made for adding new customers and new products
•	Approach to integrate above framework with the real time analytics to target customer on basis of location,
time etc. in real time.
